# Advanced Data Manipulation

## Project Overview
The "Advanced Data Manipulation" project focuses on sophisticated data manipulation techniques using R. The project is documented in an R Markdown file (`Advanced_Data_Manipulation.Rmd`), showcasing various methods for transforming and preparing data for analysis.

## Data Source
The datasets used in this project are obtained from publicly accessible data repositories. Specific details about the datasets, including their sources, are included within the R Markdown file.

- **Primary Data Source**: 
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `Advanced_Data_Manipulation.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the code and detailed explanations for the data manipulation tasks.
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used in the project.
- `output/`: Folder for any outputs generated by the R Markdown file, such as cleaned datasets or visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides a summary of the project and instructions for usage.

## Summary
This project demonstrates advanced techniques for manipulating data using R. The R Markdown file includes tasks such as data cleaning, merging, reshaping, and summarizing datasets. The final output is a clean, well-structured dataset ready for further analysis.

## Installation and Usage
To work with this project, you need R and RStudio installed on your computer. The following R packages are necessary:

- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`
- `readr`
- `stringr`
- `lubridate`

### Steps to Run:
1. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Run the code chunks sequentially to perform the data manipulation tasks.
3. Use the "Knit" function to generate a report in HTML, PDF, or Word format that documents the data manipulation steps.
